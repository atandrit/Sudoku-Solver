# Sudoku Solver

This project aims to create a simple C++ program that solves a 9x9 Sudoku puzzle using the backtracking algorithm. The backtracking algorithm is a recursive algorithm that traverses the puzzle and solves it by trying out various solutions and backtracking when it reaches a dead-end.

The program takes a 9x9 Sudoku puzzle as input and outputs the solved puzzle. The puzzle must have a unique solution for the program to work.

## Documentation


The backtracking algorithm is a general algorithm for finding all (or some) solutions to a computational problem that incrementally builds candidates to the solutions and abandons a candidate ("backtracks") as soon as it determines that the candidate cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution.

To use the program, follow these steps:

1. Create a 9x9 Sudoku puzzle in the form of a 2D array, where empty cells are represented by 0.
2. Import the C++ program into your code.
3. Call the "solveSudoku" function with the puzzle as input.
4. The program will output the solved Sudoku puzzle.
